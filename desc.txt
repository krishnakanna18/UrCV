This is my first web app that i think is project worthy and also this is my first project that i think would look legit and good 
on my resume. Originally i wanted to make a portfolio and i had an idea where i coukd develop a web app that lets other developers to make their portfolio
easily with some drag and drop options and along with some predefined templates.
Also this is my first project where im making use of a frontend end framework and im learning as im coding along with the project.
React is actually beautiful. If anyone says otherwise it only means that they couldn't get the essence of react and they probabky couldn't 
understand why react is so popular. 
First off to be a react developer is to be good at every aspect of javascript. React improves you as a javascript programmer.
Now coming onto the databse that i ve used for storing various things. First i thought of using a relatioanl database. But to user something like an entire structure of a webiste u need something mellable something that u can modify any number of times and something that goes with any type of data and is also scalable to a reasonable level and also handles concurrent transactions.
The best i could come up with was document based mongodb databse.
